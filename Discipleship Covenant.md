## Confidentiality 
I will ensure that everything shared in the Dgroup stays only within the Dgroup.
	*(Proverbs 11:13 - A gossip goes around telling secrets, but those who are trustworthy can keep a confidence)*

## Honesty
#### I will open and honest with my Dleader and fellow members.

*(Proverbs 12:22 - The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in those who tell the truth)*

## Respect
#### I will respect my Dgroup by regularly attending and participating in Dgroup meetings. I will honor my Dleader and area pastor.

*(Philippians 2:4 - Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too)*.
	
*(Hebrews 13:17 -  Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit.)*.
   
## Intercession
#### I will regularly pray for my Dleader and fellow members.
	*(Ephesians 6:18 - Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere)*
	
## Spiritual Growth
#### I have no other purpose for joining a Dgroup except to grow spiritually and help others do the same.  

*(Hebrews 10:24-25 -  24 Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. 25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.)*

## Timothies
 #### I will have it as my goal to disciple others and start a Dgroup.  
 
*(2 Timothy 2:2 - You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Now teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others.)*
